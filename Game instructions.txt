--------------------------------------------MULANDER GAME INFORMATION------------------------------------------------------------------------

Help Mulan land on as many parts of the Mun possible, safely!

In order to land, Mulan needs to fulfill the following three conditions:
1) Mulan can only land on landing zones that mission control has coloured in BRIGHT YELLOW.
2) Mulan cannot land TOO QUICKLY on the landing zone.
3) Mulan must be UPRIGHT when landing on the landing zone.

It is up to you to correctly read Mulan's sensor instruments (fuel, speed, heading, speed) to successfully explore the Mun.
If you fail either of these conditions, the mission is a failure!

In the duration of your descent, you must be careful to not run out of FUEL.
But don't worry, you will REFUEL when you land on a landing zone.
Also, the score in MULANDER is determined by how many landing zones you land on.

When you move off the right or left edge of your screen, mission control will recalibrate Mulan's sensors to be able to view more of the Mun.
But don't try to go back into space - you're going to go out of bounds and make mission control angry!

Mulan will leave a trail of smoke as you pilot around the Mun. The smoke will become bigger as Mulan moves faster, and it will 
become smaller when Mulan is slowing down.

MULANDER will be a little different every time you play. Here are some examples:
-The gravity on the Mun will vary, making Mulan feel very heavy or very light to control.
-The size of the landing zones will vary, making the task of landing more (or less) difficult.
-Mulan's starting direction will vary, which may require more (or less) turning around when preparing to descend.
-Mulan's starting vertical and horizontal speed will vary, which may require you to slow down more (or less) when descending.
-The surface of the Mun will vary in smoothness (or spikiness) in every game session.
